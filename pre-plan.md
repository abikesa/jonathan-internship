Perfect. Here's how I would **operationalize** and **automate** this internship experience into something dynamic, inspiring, and generalizable beyond just this one-off. I've broken it into a bold and executable 4-day sprint to get Jonathan ready by **Wednesday, May 14**, with scalability baked in. You'll see both the **immediate tactical response** and the **framework for generative reuse**.

## ✅ 1. QUICK COMMUNICATION TO JONATHAN (Send Now)

Jonathan,

Your 8-day internship with **Ukubona LLC** starts **Wednesday, May 14** and culminates with a final presentation on **May 27**. We’re building a custom analytics experience for you, even if you’ve never coded before. Your internship will center around something you already love: **sports**, and you’ll leave with a public-facing interactive platform that reflects your learning.

Your main goal is to build and present a prototype using the **Statlace platform**, analyzing patterns from **NFL, NBA, or baseball stats** and generating insights in a way that feels both fun and rigorous. You’ll be mentored by Vincent Jin (a brilliant software and data analyst) and Abimereki Muzaale, MD, MPH.

👉 **Kickoff meeting (in-person):** We’ll schedule one day for this—likely May 14 or 15.
👉 **Time commitment:** Expect 4–6 hours/day for 8 days = 60 hours minimum
👉 **Final presentation (in person at school):** May 27 @ 9:00 AM
👉 **Main deliverable:** A public interactive app, dashboard, or narrated video walk-through

Get ready to learn fast, build real, and have fun.

## 🧠 2. OPERATIONAL PLAN FOR MAY 14–23

Here’s the sprint structure. Everything is in service of the **Exhibition of Learning**.

### 🔹 Day 1 (May 14) – Kickoff + Setup

* In-person or Zoom kickoff
* Intro to Statlace (drag/drop interface + code sandbox)
* Choose your topic (NFL combine? NBA injury return times? Baseball pitch speed?)
* Setup GitHub + Google Drive folders
* Assignment: Watch tutorial on “Using data like a GM”

### 🔹 Day 2 – 3: Data Wrangling + Basic Visuals

* Learn: What is a CSV, JSON, or API? How to clean data
* Use Python or R notebooks to load sports datasets (Statcast, FiveThirtyEight, ESPN)
* Make your first graph (e.g., age vs. injury risk, draft round vs. earnings)

### 🔹 Day 4 – 5: Insight Extraction

* Learn how to ask a good question: “Do taller receivers earn more?” “What injuries end careers early?”
* Use conditional plots, regression, or filters
* Add dropdowns or sliders in Statlace

### 🔹 Day 6 – 7: Build Your Presentation

* Choose format: Interactive web dashboard? Prezi? Live demo?
* Add one “epistemic footnote” per insight (what could go wrong with the data)
* Draft your story arc: what did I learn, what surprised me, what do I still wonder?

### 🔹 Day 8 (May 23): Dress Rehearsal

* Practice full 10-minute talk
* Polish visuals
* Debug anything that fails live
* Reflect: one-page write-up or voice memo of “what I now understand about risk and data”

## 🧩 3. GENERALIZABLE FRAMEWORK: THE "MICRO-INTERNSHIP ENGINE"

**Statlace Modules Can Be Forked for:**

* **Public Health:** COVID school closures, vaccine hesitancy
* **Environmental Justice:** Heat risk by neighborhood
* **Education Equity:** School funding vs. outcomes
* **Policy Analysis:** Bail reform impact
* **Refugee Logistics:** Food, shelter, sanitation models

Each follows this spine:

| Day | Theme          | Skill Taught                  | Output                    |
| --- | -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1   | Curiosity      | Question framing, setup       | Framing doc               |
| 2   | Intake         | Data wrangling                | Clean dataset             |
| 3   | Representation | Basic visualization           | Static and dynamic graphs |
| 4   | Patterning     | Conditional logic, regression | Insight table             |
| 5   | Interactivity  | Filters, sliders, dashboard   | Prototype                 |
| 6   | Storytelling   | Epistemic narration           | Talk script               |
| 7   | Polish         | Debug, refine visuals         | Presentation draft        |
| 8   | Performance    | Dress rehearsal + reflection  | Public presentation       |

## ⚙️ 4. AUTOMATION PLAN

Let’s not repeat ourselves for every intern. Here's how we systematize this:

### 🔧 Tools to Set Up

* **Google Form Intake** → Collect intern goals, topics of interest
* **Notion or Airtable Tracker** → Intern status, module progress
* **Template GitHub Repo** → Cloneable Statlace starter pack
* **Statlace Module Generator** → CLI or UI tool to create a fresh sandbox with:

  * Default datasets
  * Sample visualizations
  * Narrative footnote guide
* **Auto-generated Certificate & Report** → Export as PDF from final dashboard

---

## 🕹️ Test Drive Before Wednesday

I recommend doing a quick dry run with Vincent:

* Choose a sports stat dataset from FiveThirtyEight or Kaggle
* Run it through the existing Statlace interface
* Export a graph + ask Vincent to critique: clarity, rigor, fun
* If possible: let Jonathan "click around" during Tuesday evening

Let me know if you’d like a one-page HTML internship packet or interactive dashboard scaffold by tonight—I can prep either. Would you like both?

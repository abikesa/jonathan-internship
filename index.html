      <div class="bubble d">Gd morning D,<br><br>Do you know anyone in your world that does data analytics with a focus on sports like NFL, baseball stats/ analytics? Jonathan is looking for a week long internship or job shadow arrangement as part of their graduating class requirement.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="msg from-mom">
      <div class="bubble mom">Good morning! That‚Äôs a very interesting area of focus (I wish I‚Äôd thought about it when I was Jonathan‚Äôs age!!!!). I can‚Äôt think of anyone at the top of my head. There‚Äôs a sports medicine division at Hopkins, but it‚Äôs very tiny and I have no relationship with anyone in it. The big boys in sports medicine are at Union Memorial Hospital, which is the official Ravens care provider. Don‚Äôt know anyone there either.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="msg from-d">
      <div class="bubble d">Some playful (but potentially serious) alternative to interning with a sports medicine analytics team. Can ask his school if they are cool with a remote analytics experience and that he would have a deliverable platform and output by the end.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="msg from-mom">
      <div class="bubble mom">Kadi, this sounds perfect, let me check with the school and circle back. Thanks so much.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="msg from-mom">
      <div class="bubble mom">Hey Kadi,<br>Just came from the school and we are good, they only asked that he have one in-person meeting which I think we can get creative about. We need you to sign a form so I‚Äôll have Jonathan bring that to you. I‚Äôll also send more info on dates etc.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="msg from-d">
      <div class="bubble d">Wonderful! I‚Äôm excited!!!!!<br><br>Let me loop in my mentee, he‚Äôs a brilliant fella called Vincent Jin. We‚Äôll prepare a rich one-week experience for him (see attachment). So those are the details, he would need to give a presentation at school in his learnings on May 27th. He‚Äôll have the best ‚ÄúExhibition of Learning.‚Äù</div>
    </div>

    <div class="msg from-d">
      <div class="bubble d">For May 27 :)</div>
    </div>

    <div class="msg from-mom">
      <div class="bubble mom">This is awesome Kadi, thanks so much. FYI, Jonathan has no prior experience with data analytics, only as a consumer ü§£ü§£‚Ä¶..I‚Äôm excited for him‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.We‚Äôve tried but I think we don‚Äôt know how to inspire gen whatever this is.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="msg from-d">
      <div class="bubble d">No worries. Haha. Everything will result in an interactive app-like platform. So that should engage him :)</div>
